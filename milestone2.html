<h1><u>COMMUNITY SERVICE</u></h1>
<p><big>Community service is work done by a person or group of people that benefits others</big>. It is often done near the area where you live, so your own community reaps the benefits of your work. <big>You do not get paid to perform community service</big>, though sometimes food and small gifts, like a t-shirt, are given to volunteers
</p>
<p><big>Community service can help any group of people in need:</big> children, senior citizens, people with disabilities, English language learners, and more. It can also help animals, such as those at a shelter, and it can be used to improve places, such as a local park, historic building, or scenic area as well. <big>Community service is often organized</big> through a local group, such as a place of worship, school, or non-profit organization. You can also start your own community service projects.
